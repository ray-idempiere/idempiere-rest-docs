# Health Check Endpoint

The Health Check endpoint provides a way to monitor the availability and status of the iDempiere REST API service.

By default this endpoint is public (it doesn't require any authentication).  It can be configured to require a key simply by creating the SysConfig `REST_HEALTH_MONITORING_KEY`

The answer for this endpoint is cached, the cached version is returned if called before the cache duration.  Cache duration is 20 seconds by default, and it can be configured passing a System Property `REST_HEALTH_CACHE_DURATION_PROPERTY` to the JVM.

## Overview

This endpoint is useful for:

- Load balancer health probes
- Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes
- Monitoring systems
- Service discovery
